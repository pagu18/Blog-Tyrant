         <p>Feminism is a way of thinking grasped by all legitimate and instructed individuals around the
            world, however it is anything but a reasonable battleground when women in attire of feminism
            target men and take part in the death of the character. All through Indian culture, we admire and
            supplicate numerous goddesses. The ones who spread pseudo feminism accomplish more
            mischief than anything. A few people are continually going to raise their support to women
            privileges and females need to acknowledge that to change the society. Second, they need to
            comprehend that men are not awful and that our society has few great individuals who support
            feminism but not female chauvinism.<br><br>

            Pseudo Feminism identifies with women inequality and men's contempt. It's not about fairness,
but rather retribution for the barbarities and the power and misuse that females face because of
society. However, the most disturbing reality is about how these pseudo feminists scout defects
in everything men do, discovering approaches to make them look terrible, portraying them as
suspects and then playing victim cards. Besides, half baked knowledge is more regrettable than
obliviousness, so it is ideal to clarify all the proof prior to mark individual with abusive words
and certain allegation such as "All men are dogs" and " All men are same".<br><br>
            
I want to make one point very clear that I am not saying that Feminism is soiled, all I want to
conclude is people in the disguise of feminism supports pseudo feminism and this will not be
accepted as all the members of our society are on an equal footing as mentioned in Article 14 of
our constitution. I will not be supporting the superiority of one segment of the society on the
expense of other. I definitely support feminism but to remove the Feminazism, we need to
educate ourselves and we need to educate our society so that no one can be discriminated on
unjust biases. Not just "women lives matter" or "men lives matter" it be that "All lives
matter". <b>It is not feminism, it is pseudo feminism.</b> </p>
